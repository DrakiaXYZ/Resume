## Programming Experience ##
### OSRose/OSpRose Projects (Sept. '07 - Feb. '09)
* https://github.com/TheDgtl/osrose

Worked closely with a small team to implement new features and revamp existing features in a multi-daemon game server. Reverse engineered packet and encryption protocols to allow interoperability with existing clients. Communicated with various individuals working on similar projects to trade concepts and code. Managed a fork of the primary project for an older version of the game client.

### TitanFiesta Project (July '08 - Aug. '09)
* https://github.com/TheDgtl/titanfiesta
* http://titanfiesta.wikidot.com/

Created the base of a game server from the ground up with a small team. Reverse engineered packet encryption and protocol for existing client interoperability. Used a centralized "inter-server-communication" server for multi-daemon communication. Created tools required for further client modification and customization.

### Bukkit (Minecraft) Plugins (Feb. '11 - Mar. '13)
* http://thedgtl.net/bukkit/

Created, managed and supported multiple Bukkit plugins, designed for maximum customization by users. Offered support and updates for all plugins for the past year. Keep tabs on upstream changes in both Bukkit as well as any depended upon plugins. Implemented feature requests from users.

### Chef Multicraft Cookbook (Apr. '12)
* https://github.com/TheDgtl/chef-repo/tree/master/cookbooks/multicraft

As an introduction to OpsCode Chef I created a cookbook to allow easy deployment of a Multicraft Control Panel as well as multiple Multicraft Daemon nodes. Included is the ability to automatically generate a multicraft.key file if a key is supplied, as well as node discovery to automatically setup daemon and control panel communication.
